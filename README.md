Getting practice with D3 visualizations and web scraping

I will be making a relationship graph that shows the connections between different mathematicians

The data will be scraped from here http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/BiogIndex.html, and the links will be base on the amount of references to other mathematicians on their bio page
